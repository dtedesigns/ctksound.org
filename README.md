Christ the King Sound Team
==========================

This is a repository for all [CTKSound.org](http://recordings.ctksound.org) source code.

Master Branch - Version 3.0
---------------------------
Master branch has become version 3.0.  Version 3 will be less a unified application and more a set of tools.

1. http://recordings.ctksound.org/ will be where all the recordings will reside.
2. Original FLAC recordings will be archived.
  - This may not be necessary if Amazon S3 prices continue to fall.
  - Archiving to Glacier adds a level of complexity that I'd like to avoid, if possible.
