  notes: >
    There were some problems with this recording.  Both the opening
    and closing prayers are missing and we are missing less than a
    minute from the beginning of the sermon itself.  That said,
    the missing sections are not too obvious and I was able to start
    the sermon at a point that appears natural. I've decided it is
    worth keeping.
